A simplified version of the card game, War, that allows the player to challenge a computer-generated opponent for the win. This game contains the same rules and mechanics as real-life game. The player and the cpu are given a random hand of shuffled cards and the two players each present one card each turn. The player with the higher ranked card wins the round and obtains both cards. The player with the higher stack of cards after all the cards are taken is the winner. If two players present cards with the same rank, then there is a "war", in which the two players must present the next card to determine the true victor of that round. If one of the players has less than 5 cards, then the war is already lost and the other player claims the cards.
